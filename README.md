# Thermoacoustics
Projects having to do with thermoacoustic refrigerators and engines.

## Spring 2022 - Advanced Physics Laboratory

### TAR.jl
General scratch work. Includes sources!

### Scripts
Scratch Python scripts, mostly for calibrating an Adafruit Microphone with an Arduino. The data from the Adafruit microphone is saved (via PuTTY) to a file called `microphone.log`, which then has to be cleaned using our Python scripts. Actually, I don't think we ended up using any of these scripts...
